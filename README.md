## What is the abundance and impact of zebra mussel populations in US freshwater lakes?

We are looking at data from three separate data sets that were found on DataOne by querying "zebra mussels" and constraining our search to the US. Our goal is to integrate these data sets to answer our question above. We will be using the google drive API to interact with our data sets.

The data sets can be found here in our data log:

If new data sets are found, the log will be updated to keep track of all the data sets that we look at, whether they are included in our analysis or not.

The goal of this group project is to practice re-using data and merging data sets to find new insights. We also want to learn about preserving our scientific products on a data repository.
