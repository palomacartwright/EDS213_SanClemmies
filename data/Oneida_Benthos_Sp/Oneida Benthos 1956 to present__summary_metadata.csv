Dataset_Abstract,"This dataset contains benthic invertebrate data from Ekman grab samples on Oneida Lake and is part of the collection ""Cornell Oneida Lake Data"".  The Cornell Biological Field Station (CBFS) serves as a primary field site for aquatic research at Cornell University (more information can be found at http://www.cbfs.dnr.cornell.edu) and is part of the Department of Natural Resources, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Cornell University.  The centerpiece of the station's research program is a 60+ year database on the food web of Oneida Lake, New York, that has been collected with support from the Cornell University Brown Endowment and from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.   The data are collected by personnel from the Cornell Biological Field Station and include limnology, benthos,  zooplankton, phytoplankton, and fish survey data, primarily from Oneida Lake and spanning 1956 to the present.  This dataset contains counts of benthic invertebrates sampled since 1956 at three to seven locations per year on Oneida Lake in central New York state.  Samples were collected using an Ekman sampler, and invertebrates were handpicked from samples and identified, taxonomic level varies.  The dataset is comprised of a primary table with a summary of the data available organized by taxonomic groups defined in the taxonomy table.  Fields also include year, depth category (shallow versus deep sites) and season. A third table contains latitude and longitude in decimal degrees for each site as well as the classification of each site as shallow or deep sites.  This is a companion data set to the book Oneida Lake: Long-term dynamics of a managed ecosystem and its fisheries, edited by LG Rudstam, EL Mills, JR Jackson and DJ Stewart and published by the American Fisheries Society, Bethesda, Maryland. It is updated annually."
Dataset_Methods,"Samples of benthic invertebrates were collected from 1956 to 2014 at various intervals during (at minimum) the months of June, July, and August.  In some years, samples were collected during April, May, September, October, and November as well.  Samples were therefore classified as being either from Spring (March-May), Summer (June- August, the majority of samples), of Fall (September-November).  Depending upon the year, samples were collected at between three and seven sites located on Oneida Lake (see Benthos location table).  From 1956 to 1977, 2-5 replicate samples were collected at some of the sample sites.  Samples were collected using a 152x152 mm square (0.023 m2) Ekman grab sampler as shown in figure 12.1 of Wetzel, R. G., and G. E. Likens. 2000. Limnological analyses, 3rd edition. Springer-Verlag Inc, New York, NY, p. 191. Samples were passed through a 253 micrometer mesh screen, and preserved in ethanol and stained with rose bengal. Organisms were removed from samples without a hand lens or microscope, and categorized to various taxonomic levels, mostly family or higher level.  Since 1999, samples have been processed by Dr John Cooper. Prior to 1999, samples were processed by technicians at CBFS with varying taxonomic abilities.  Data in the summary table are organized by groups as defined in the taxonomy table.  Data are density in number per m2.  Densities were obtained by first calculating average density of the group from replicate samples to obtain an average value for each unique site â€“ date combination.  Averages for season and depth group was then obtained from the average of these site-date combination that were included in each depthgroup/season category.  Averages were calculated separately for each year and densities in number per m2 calculated by dividing the average count per Ekman grab with the area of the grab (0.023 m2).  Not all taxa were counted during all years of the dataset and this information is available in the taxonomy table.  The value -999 is used in this table to indicate that counts for particular taxa were not collected for a given sample.  The data from 1967 to 1997 are published in Mayer, C. M., R. A. Keats, L. G. Rudstam, and E. L. Mills. 2002. Scale-dependent effects of zebra mussels on benthic invertebrates in a large eutrophic lake. Journal of The North American Benthological Society 21, 616-633.   For years 1956 to 1963, 1965-66 and 1969, chironomids were not counted.  Volumetric measures were available and the correlation between average volume and average count for years 1964, 1967-68 and 1970-71 was high.  Forcing the relationship through 0 gave the equation ChironomidCounts = 39.42 * ChironomidVolume, N=15, R2=0.864.  We used this equation to calculate chironomids counts from volume for years with missing counts.   A few samples had small dreissenid mussels that were not identified to species.  These were apportioned to zebra and quagga mussels in proportion to the identified animals. In 2019, dreissenids were not identified to species and both zebra and quagga mussels were classified as Dreissena.  Details of dreissenidfor 2019  are found in the mussel datapackage."
